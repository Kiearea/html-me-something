          <p class="italics">"Stacey, they're threating to call the police. Talmbout, they've told me before to stop coming in here with fake checks. I only scammed them
          like, 6 times! Can you PLEASE speak with the bank manager to straighten this out?"</p>

          <p>This was the last statement I made to a "recruiter" when I pretended I was depositing a check "she" mailed to me the day before.
          The police had been notified of my attempt to deposit yet ANOTHER bad check and were on the way to take me in. How did I wind up in this
          precarious position? Well, right here what we gon' do is go back *cues  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNk3R23Twgw">*Erykah Badu*</a></p>

          <p>A few weeks prior, I'd applied for several remote jobs. I've never worked remotely before so I had no clue how recruiting/interviewing worked
           or how things are typically done. One position for which I applied was a Graphic Designer position with a paper company located in Spokane
           Washington. Imagine my excitement when I received an email back from Stacey, a senior HR recruiter. She stated she was impressed with my resume
           and wanted to know what day/time I had available. I gave her a day and time (something like Wednesday afternoon) and she responded with:</p>
           <p class="italics">"Let us meet Friday at 8am."</p>

           <p>...Oh-kay. Why ask me about MY availability if you're going to just GIVE me a time? But I rolled with it assuming this was par for the course
           when applying for remote positions. I responded with:</p> <p><span class="italics">"Friday at 8am will be great!"</span> <span>and began to prepare for the big day.</span></p>

        <img src="photos/interview.jpg" alt="In focus camera pointed towards bookshelf">
        <div class="interview">
        <p>The day of the interview arrives and I'm taken by surprise that instead of receiving a phone call, I get a Google Hangouts message from Stacey.
           She begins the conversation by saying 'Good Morning.' I respond and ask if we were going to chat over the phone. Like I initially thought we would.
           She stated that the interview would be conducted over Google Hangouts. <span>*Red Flag number 1*</span></p>
        <p>I was skeptical (her messages to me were in broken English) but she began asking legitimate interview questions (How long have you done graphic design work?
           Do you have experience with Photoshop? Illustrator? etc.) which put my mind at ease. It would take her several minutes to reply to my answers leading me to believe she was
           interviewing several people at once. Which explained why despite my schedule, she chose 8am on Friday. To kill 1,800 birds with one stone.</p>

        <p>At the end of my interview she told me to 'stand by' while she submitted my info to the hiring manager. I'd never had an interview where I'd
          be informed immediately if I'd been selected. I chalked it up to being new to the remote working environment. I 'stood by' for about 7 hours and
          didn't hear from Stacey again that day.</p>

        <p>First thing Monday morning, I FINALLY get a response from Stacey informing me that I'd been hired and they wanted to begin my training right away.
          Stacey told me the company would send me all the equipment I'd need to get started. Such equipment included a MacBook Pro, a Cannon Inkjet printer,
          and a few other miscellaneous items. But before providing any additional info, Stacey asked if I had a bank account. <span>*Red Flag number 2*</span></p>

        <img src="photos/detective.jpg" alt="Cardi B">
        <div class="skeptic">
          <p>I informed her that I did indeed have a bank account and asked why THAT particular information was so important. Stacey responded by saying it was
            because The Company would send me a check for the equipment and wanted to make sure they had someone trustworthy. Alarm bells at 5-alarm-fire, I decided
            to do a bit more research on "Stacey". I went to her LinkedIn account and found her profile. Everything on her communications matched her profile. But
            if I could find her info so easily, so could anyone else. I found a website where someone else had (nearly) fallen victim to this scam. Everything seemed eerily
            similar to my experience thus far but he/she was able to get an actual name. He/she didn't list it, just noted that it sounded like an Islamic name. It seems they stepped their game up
            before approaching the kid. Stacey's e-mail seemed valid (company .com email), I could find her on LinkedIn and the job was posted on a site that requires a $300 to post your job ad
            for a month.</p>

          <p>Still unconvinced of the jobs' validity, I Googled the company, found their phone number and gave them a call. Stacey was out for the
            day but I was able to speak to her coworker, *Dave, another Senior HR rep. Because he was in another state, he couldn't confirm or deny if she'd
            posted a Graphic Designer job, but he DID tell me he wasn't aware of any remote postings. He also advised I proceed with caution if I continued
            communications with Stacey.</p>

        <div class="license">
          <p>I decided to do just that. I wouldn't provide any real information (although they had a little from my initial application) while still holding on
           to the sliver of hope that this was indeed real. Tuesday morning, Stacey sends over my new hire packet and asked me to fill it out immediately. The
           packet asked for my address, drivers license and social security number. While looking it over, Stacey messages me to confirm, once more that I have
           a bank account. She continues by saying once she received my filled-out new hire packet she would mail me the check for my office equipment. And that
           I am to IMMEDIATELY put it into my bank account. 1000% certain this is a capital 's' scam, I decided to have a little fun with them. For wasting my time.
           For getting my hopes up. Or maybe because I, the great and awesome Rachel had been duped for like 3 days and I COULD NOT let that slide. But if I had,
           you wouldn't have such an entertaining story now would you? :)</p>

          <p>I made a fake drivers license, complete with a fake address and social. My REAL address was on my resume which they had and
           I wondered if they'd notice the difference. They didn't. Once receiving my doctored info, Stacey quickly informed me that she was mailing my check. She also stated
           I would have to put the check into my bank account and use the funds to purchase my equipment from their designated vendor. She asked one final time if I had
           a bank account and I responded:</p>

           <p class="italics">"I have to be honest. I don't have a bank account per se (I have some THANGS on my credit report that make opening a bank account
           difficult). I hope that won't be a problem."</p>

           <p>Stacey replied it would be an issue. I told her I'd use my underage daughters bank account instead. She replied with 'OK' and told me to look out for
           the check the next morning.</p>

        <img src="photos/bank_receipt.jpg" alt="Bank Deposit" class="left">
        <div class="deposit">
          <p>Early the next day, I hear a knock at the door and I know exactly who/what it is. The check had been delivered to my correct address (despite my providing 2)
           Not even 10 minutes later Stacey sends a message informing me that the check had been delivered and for me to go get it immediately. She's not the boss
           of me! After showering and rubbing on a body butter, I waltzed my way to the front door to see that scam lying on my welcome mat. I open it up and it's a
           'check' for $4,800. </p>

          <p>It looks like a real check. It even has watermarks and everything! But the routing number looked a bit off. My years of working in Finance had finally paid off! And just to be 100% sure,
            I decided to double-check the routing number with the ABA's routing number lookup system. Lo and behold, this check is a fake! Uh-oh. I'd spent too much time verifying the checks' validity.
            Stacey is probably wondering what's taking me so long. I tell Stacey I had the check and she instructs me to take it to my bank ASAP. I told her I'd get dressed and be on my way. She continued
            by instructing me to send her a screenshot of my deposit after I'd put the money in my account. Pffffttt! Not the kid! So I Googled a deposit slip unrelated to my REAL bank account, photoshopped it,
            and sent that bad boy over.

        <img src="photos/police.jpg" alt="Won't Let Me Leave" class="leave">
        <div class="po-po">
          <p>Thrilled, Stacey asks:</p>
            <p class="italics">"What is your available balance?"</p>
            <p>I tell her:</p> <p class="italics">"4,100. I had some overdraft fees on my account".</p>
            <p>She responds with:</p> <p class="italics">"That's fine. Will update you with vendor info tomorrow."</p>
          </p>

          <p>Tomorrow comes and Stacey instructs me to go to Chase bank with a cashier’s check for $3,800 for my equipment. But I don't quite get that far. I text
            Stacey to let her know my bank isn't too happy with my latest deposit. I told her they were threating to call the police. I couldn't be seen in that state! I wasn't wearing my good wig! I had
            on Dora the Explorer house-shoes! I continued by stating the police were threatening to take me back to prison and I couldn't go back. I already did 5 years of hard time! She had only one response:</p>
            <p class="italics">"Why you would say check is fake?"</p>
            <p class="italics">"I didn't! The bank said it was fake! What's going on Stacey?!"</p>
          </p>

          <p>Needless to say, I my correspondence with Stacey stopped abruptly. That heffa doesn’t even care that I'm STILL in prison! LOL! Where hopefully, she'll be joining me. I sent all their
            information to the FBI's Cyber Crime Unit. I hope they catch them. I’m certain they’ve succeeded with this scam and stole from some innocent people. It's a sucky thing to steal from
            folks and even suckier to steal from people looking for work. It's like kicking them when they're down. And that's my story. How I finessed some losers out of their account information.
            Now, who wants to buy some Amazon gift cards?! I know a guy who's buying!
